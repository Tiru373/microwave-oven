# Microwave Oven Simulation Project

## Overview
This README provides a simple and clear explanation of the Microwave Oven Simulation Project completed during your internship at Emertxe Information Technologies. The project involves simulating a microwave oven using a PIC16F877A microcontroller, MPLAB, PICSimLab, and the XC8 microcontroller compiler. The simulation has four modes: Micro, Grill, Convection, and Start Mode.

## Project Description

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a simulated microwave oven with four modes: Micro, Grill, Convection, and Start Mode. It acts like a real microwave oven, allowing users to set cooking times, temperatures, and power levels.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **PIC16F877A Microcontroller**: The brain of the project, controlling the microwave oven functions.
- **MPLAB**: The software where you write, compile, and debug code for the microcontroller.
- **PICSimLab**: A simulator for PIC microcontrollers that helps you test your code without actual hardware.
- **XC8 Compiler**: This tool converts high-level code into machine code that the microcontroller can understand.

## Project Features

1. **Four Modes of Operation**:
   - **Micro Mode**: Simulates microwave cooking with time and power settings.
   - **Grill Mode**: Emulates grilling with temperature and time settings.
   - **Convection Mode**: Replicates convection cooking with fan speed, temperature, and time settings.
   - **Start Mode**: A generic mode that starts cooking based on the selected settings.

2. **Virtual Interface**: The project has a simple on-screen display mimicking a microwave oven's control panel. It shows information like cooking time, temperature, power, and cooking status, depending on the chosen mode.

3. **Settings and Control**: Users can set cooking parameters for each mode, like time, temperature, power, or fan speed. The project responds according to the selected mode.

4. **Start and Stop**: You can start the microwave with your chosen settings in any mode and stop it whenever you like.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. [MPLAB](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide)
2. [XC8 Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers)
3. [PICSimLab](https://sourceforge.net/projects/picsim/)

### Project Setup

1. Download or clone the project code from your supervisor or mentor.

2. Open MPLAB and load the project workspace (`.X` file).

3. Connect PICSimLab to MPLAB for simulating the microcontroller.

4. Compile the code using the XC8 compiler.

5. Start the simulation in PICSimLab to test the microwave oven interface and its functions.

## Usage

1. Launch the simulation in PICSimLab.

2. Use the virtual interface to set cooking times, temperatures, power, or fan speeds based on the selected mode.

3. Start the microwave to begin cooking according to the specified settings.

4. Observe the simulation to ensure it behaves like a real microwave oven for each mode.

5. Make any necessary code or simulation adjustments as needed.
